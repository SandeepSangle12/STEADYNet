STEADYNet: Low Complexity Unified CNN model for Improving Dementia Detection
# STEADYNet
The efficiency of the proposed STEADYNet exhibits the lowest computation complexity in terms of both the number of floating point operations and inference time using publicaly available datasets. STEADYNet outperforms existing EEG-based AD detection systems with an accuracy of $99.29\%$ while having the least number of trainable parameters. The proposed STEADYNet is a valuable aid for neurologists.
